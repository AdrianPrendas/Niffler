## Globals Applications Course ##

The project must be an idea that can be helpful to our society. <br>
After the study of the globalization topic we understand that we must be part of the change.

### Niffler is an application that helps their user to admin their finance transactions ###

This app will be developed with javascript technologies <br>
<ul>
  <li>Server side Javascript</li>
  <li>Non relational database MongoDB</li>
  <li>React Navite for the client</li>
</ul>

The idea is that the user register each transaction to know how much money spent for the day, week, month and year
the app also has a debts module where the user can set the bills that must pay in the month to have calculated their budget.

Sketch of the idea:
